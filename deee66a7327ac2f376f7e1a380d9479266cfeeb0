Those methods are the place to update fields like the height, when e.g. the number of options changes.\n\n\u003chere is my question about gerrithub usage - if i want to make my (rather small) changes to somebody else\u0027s commits before they got verified - like in this case - should i change them in their commit? Or should i submit another commit sourcing from this?\u003e",
